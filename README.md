# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
Welcome to my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
I am an arts administrator currently pursuing my Master in Arts Management at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am also a contributor to the Arts Management & Technology Laboratory. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an Assistant Program Manager for the Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance, where I focused on developing organizational best practices as well as programming that addresses explicit and implicit bias in cultural organizations. Additionally, I have worked for Manhattan Theatre Club, Maryland Humanities, and Theatre Communications Group. A passionate theatre maker, I was an Ensemble Member with Single Carrot Theatre for five years â€“ devising, directing, and performing in new plays. Beyond my love for the arts, I enjoy hiking, baking, eating pizza, and spending time with with friends, family, and my doggo, August. 

# What I Hope to Learn
After years of being behind the other industries, the cultural sectors have not only broadly embraced the importance of data, but many organizations of varying sizes have made concerted efforts to collect and track audience, donor, and artist information. This shift has changed the way cultural organizations are making strategic marketing, fundraising, and programming decisions, but I would say there is still an analysis deficit in many artistic fields. In my experience, while arts managers may have had access to a significant amount of data, there is a lack of expertise regarding how to organize, interpret, and share the information it contains both internally and with external stakeholders. I hope that this course provides a thorough enough introduction to tools for data visualization so that my skillsets not only address this deficit and are more valuable to future employers, but so that these tools can be explained and introduced more broadly to the cultural sectors.
