# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
Welcome to my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!


# About Me
Hello! I am an arts administrator currently pursuing my Master in Arts Management at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am also a contributor to the Arts Management & Technology Laboratory. I also work for City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, an organization that provides sanctuary to endangered literary writers from around the world. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an Assistant Program Manager for the Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance, where I focused on developing organizational best practices as well as programming that addresses explicit and implicit bias in cultural organizations. Additionally, I have worked for Manhattan Theatre Club, Maryland Humanities, and Theatre Communications Group. A passionate theatre maker, I was an Ensemble Member with Single Carrot Theatre for five years â€“ devising, directing, and performing in new plays. Beyond my love for the arts, I enjoy hiking, baking, eating pizza, and spending time with with friends, family, and my doggo, August. 


# What I Hope to Learn
After years of being behind other industries, the cultural sector has not only broadly embraced the importance of data, but many organizations of varying sizes have made concerted efforts to collect and track audience, donor, and artist information. This shift has changed the way cultural organizations are making strategic marketing, fundraising, and programming decisions, but I would say there is still an analysis deficit in many artistic fields. In my experience, while arts managers may have had access to a significant amount of data, there is a lack of expertise regarding how to organize, interpret, and share the information it contains both internally and with external stakeholders. I hope that this course provides a thorough enough introduction to tools for data visualization so that my skillsets not only address this deficit and are more valuable to future employers, but so that these tools can be explained and introduced more broadly to the field.

Here is where all of my cool data visualizations will go!

For the above chart, I extracted data from the above referenced "Policy Analysis Report." To do this, I used Tabula to be able to copy and paste data from the PDF into a Google Sheet. In the Google Sheet, I inserted a Column Chart, not stacked, and reduced the series in the chart setup to "Spending Per Capita." I added both a chart title and subtitle via the Customize tab in the chart editor. In this tab I also set the legend to "none" and edited the vertical axis minimum and maximum to "0" and "45," respectively, to reflect dollar amounts in increments of $5. The data was then sorted so that spending per capita was represented from least to greatest.
