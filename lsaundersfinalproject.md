# My Final Project: Changes in American Theatre Leadership 

## Summary
Since 2015, the American theatre has experienced unprecendented turnover in both its artistic and management leadership. During this time, artists, arts managers, and audiences have called upon those steering hiring operations, namely theatre's governing bodies, to ensure more equitable hiring processes. Using data captured by Bay Area theatre professionals, which has and continues to track artistic and managing director hires from 2015 through today, this project will show demographic shifts, specifically in gender and race, in American theatre leadership.
