# My Final Project: Changes in American Theatre Leadership 

## Part I: Outline
### _Summary_
Since 2015, the American theatre has experienced unprecendented turnover in both its artistic and management leadership. During this time, artists, arts managers, and audiences have called upon those steering hiring operations, namely theatre's governing bodies, to ensure more equitable hiring processes. Using data captured by Bay Area theatre professionals, which has and continues to track artistic and managing director hires from 2015 through today, this project will show demographic shifts, specifically in gender and race, in American theatre leadership. 

### _Project Structure_
**Setup**: For many years, the American theatre as a field (both professional union, professional non-union, and community) has been artistically and executively led by white men.

**Conflict**: In 2015, the retirement of many of these leaders led to a high number of executive searches, and presented both an opportunity and a challenge for organization's to hire new talent that better represents the communities they serve.

**Resolution**: As of February 2019, there have been shifts in leadership that reflect a concerted effort to increase female leaderships, however both gender and broader representation in the field are significantly lagging. 


## The Data 
Developed and maintained by professional director and _Howlround Theatre Commons_ contributor Rebecca Novick, and director of new plays and marketing for Golden Threat Productions Evren Odcikin, the [American Theater Leadership Change database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1J-OnNvSwaA0oh2olzuodjKQgU1uIGHyhEXAPeCO7IAQ/htmlview#) has tracked hires for artistic and managing director positions across the country since 2015. The data is aggregated in a Google sheet, where it is regularly updated, with the most recent change being made this February 2019. It is also collected through different avenues, including crowdsourcing. Individuals and organizations can report hires by e-mailing Novick and Odcikin, who verify the change, and then record it. I plan to use this information to not just visualize changes in American theatre leadership, but also to visualize the changes over time to see if there are any noticeable trends that have developed over the last four years, and if yes, what such trends might infer about the future of the field.

## Method and Medium 
To complete my final project I will be using the digital storytelling platform [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com). This platform will allow me to incorporate multimedia content and other resources to strengthen the story that supports and informs my data visualizations. I will create at least one visualization that shows the arc of the story detailed in my outline above. To do this, I will use tools we have explored in class, such as RawGraphs and Datawrapper, and potentially learn how to use other resources depending on whether or not it is determined that animated or geospatial visualizations will best show changes in American theatre leadership. 

Before commiting to a specific tool(s) to create my visualizations, I will research ways in which similar data in other fields has been visualized, and will also use found examples of well-executed visualizations as inspiration for my wireframes. Next, I will sketch said wireframes, and insert them into a preliminary storyboard to see if they support what I want my audience to take away. The wireframes will be shared with three individuals for feedback, and will be altered to strengthen the final story. Once the wireframes and storyboard are finalized, I will build my visualizations and then finally input all of my content into Shorthand. 


## Part II: Sketches, Wireframes, and Storyboards
### _Sketches and Storyboard_
My approach to initializing my sketches was to look at some examples of other visualizations of equity, diversity, and inclusion in both arts and culture and more broadly. Interestingly, a lot of pie charts are used for such visual representations. The database where this information comes from took a different approach, using stacked bar charts in one of its tabs. We have discussed in class, and in other spaces at Heinz, how pie charts are not always the best choice for a visualization, but there was something about "who gets the slice of the pie" that had a nice ring to it when I thought about hiring practices. With this in mind, I started sketching out pie charts, which you can see below:

When looking at these sketches a number of questions began to swirl in my head, like will the pie slices be easy to decipher at a quick glance? Does the completely filled pie work? Also, I realized if I wanted to show all of the different demographic changes in one place, there would just be a regular pie chart, which neither seemed fitting or interesting enough for the story I am hoping to tell. 

I went back to the drawing board - literally - and thought about how a small number of colored icons would be striking against gray, and might highlight small numbers of certain demographics in a way that could be more striking. I decided to draw out a number of stick figures to see what this might look like:

After realizing how terrible I am at drawing circles and lines, and how further pursuing this idea would require a lot more of that activity, I almost gave up. My friend Katie, another student, came to my rescue by pointing out that this would be much easier to draft in Infogram - and she was right! With Infogram's tools I was able to come up with the following two visualizations: 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="d1b3a2b1-944e-441f-961c-845784ca6452" data-type="interactive" data-title="TSWD - Wireframe AD"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/d1b3a2b1-944e-441f-961c-845784ca6452" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">TSWD - Wireframe AD</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>


<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="2c635af3-28cb-40ec-a36c-7e7117811a7e" data-type="interactive" data-title="TSWD - Wireframe MD"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/2c635af3-28cb-40ec-a36c-7e7117811a7e" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">TSWD - Wireframe MD</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>



Now that I had these solid sketches, I sat down to storyboard. In this instance, I tried seeing how numerical figures, text, images, and data visualizations can be balanced out, because while I want one or a short series of visualizations to tell my story, how those visualizations are contextualized in Shorthand I fear will be ineffective if I rely solely on images alone. Where I landed with my storyboard is below, although there are still a few things I am unsure about - specifically the moments right before the visualizations are shared (cards 8 and 10):

### _Research Protocol and Findings_
_Target Audience_: My target audience is individuals who are familiar and/or a fan of American theatre, but are not embedded in the field explicitly as an arts administrator or manager. Instead, my audience is made up of internal and external stakeholders, such as board and committee members, artists, funders, and audiences.
