# My Final Project: Changes in American Theatre Leadership 

## Outline
### _Summary_
Since 2015, the American theatre has experienced unprecendented turnover in both its artistic and management leadership. During this time, artists, arts managers, and audiences have called upon those steering hiring operations, namely theatre's governing bodies, to ensure more equitable hiring processes. Using data captured by Bay Area theatre professionals, which has and continues to track artistic and managing director hires from 2015 through today, this project will show demographic shifts, specifically in gender and race, in American theatre leadership. 

### _Project Structure_
**Setup**: For many years, the American theatre as a field (both professional union, professional non-union, and community) has been artistically and executively led by white men.

**Conflict**: In 2015, the retirement of many of these leaders led to a high number of executive searches, and presented both an opportunity and a challenge for organization's to hire new talent that better represents the communities they serve.

**Resolution**: As of February 2019, there have been shifts in leadership that reflect a concerted effort to increase female leaderships, however both gender and broader representation in the field are significantly lagging. 


## The Data 
Developed and maintained by professional director and _Howlround Theatre Commons_ contributor Rebecca Novick, and director of new plays and marketing for Golden Threat Productions Evren Odcikin, the [American Theater Leadership Change database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1J-OnNvSwaA0oh2olzuodjKQgU1uIGHyhEXAPeCO7IAQ/htmlview#) has tracked hires for artistic and managing director positions across the country since 2015. The data is aggregated in a Google sheet, where it is regularly updated, with the most recent change being made this February 2019. It is also collected through different avenues, including crowdsourcing. Individuals and organizations can report hires by e-mailing Novick and Odcikin, who verify the change, and then record it. I plan to use this information to not just visualize changes in American theatre leadership, but also to visualize the changes over time to see if there are any noticeable trends that have developed over the last four years, and if yes, what such trends might infer about the future of the field.

## Method and Medium 
To complete my final project I will be using the digital storytelling platform [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com). This platform will allow me to incorporate multimedia content and other resources to strengthen the story that supports and informs my data visualizations. I will create at least one visualization that shows the arc of the story detailed in my outline above. To do this, I will use tools we have explored in class, such as RawGraphs and Datawrapper, and potentially learn how to use other resources depending on whether or not it is determined that animated or geospatial visualizations will best show changes in American theatre leadership. 

Before commiting to a specific tool(s) to create my visualizations, I will research ways in which similar data in other fields has been visualized, and will also use found examples of well-executed visualizations as inspiration for my wireframes. Next, I will sketch said wireframes, and insert them into a preliminary storyboard to see if they support what I want my audience to take away. The wireframes will be shared with three individuals for feedback, and will be altered to strengthen the final story. Once the wireframes and storyboard are finalized, I will build my visualizations and then finally input all of my content into Shorthand.
