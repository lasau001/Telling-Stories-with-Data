# My Final Project: Changes in American Theatre Leadership 

## Summary
Since 2015, the American theatre has experienced unprecendented turnover in both its artistic and management leadership. During this time, artists, arts managers, and audiences have called upon those steering hiring operations, namely theatre's governing bodies, to ensure more equitable hiring processes. Using data captured by Bay Area theatre professionals, which has and continues to track artistic and managing director hires from 2015 through today, this project will show demographic shifts, specifically in gender and race, in American theatre leadership. 

## The Data 
Developed and maintained by professional director and _Howlround Theatre Commons_ contributor Rebecca Novick, and director of new plays and marketing for Golden Threat Productions Evren Odcikin, the [American Theater Leadership Change database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1J-OnNvSwaA0oh2olzuodjKQgU1uIGHyhEXAPeCO7IAQ/htmlview#) has tracked hires for artistic and managing director positions across the country since 2015. The data is aggregated in a Google sheet, where it is regularly updated, with the most recent change being made this February 2019. It is also collected through different avenues, including crowdsourcing. Individuals and organizations can report hires by e-mailing Novick and Odcikin, who verify the change, and then record it. I plan to use this information to not just visualize changes in American theatre leadership, but also to visualize the changes over time to see if there are any noticeable trends that have developed over the last four years, and if yes, what such trends might infer about the future of the field.
